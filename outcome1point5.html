    <h1>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –
    how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h1>
<body>
    <p>There are many different programs, systems and software that can be used to digitally create and provide solutions to a project problem.<br>
    Finding and using the right type of technology however can sometimes seem like a daunting process if the project needs venture into unexplored territory.<br>
    At base choosing the technology to use in a project either make or break a project.<br>
    It is for these reasons that when beginning a new project I always create a plan with the client, in which all of the project aims and outcomes are listed.
    <br><br>Using that initial plan as a guide you can assess and identify smaller tasks that need to be completed in order for you to create a list of things to do.
    <br>Once a to-do list has been made you can then look into the technology and tools already at your disposal that answer the questions;
    <br>Can we create or solve this using that?<br> Is there other software that we can apply our 
    current digital knowledge to in order to create a better product?<br> How will using this programme work with solving additional
     tasks on the list?<br> If it doesn't what other programme or 
    software does that can work well with the tech we are already implementing. <br> 
    And overall what effects will using these technologies have on project budget? <br><br>
    “there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital people.” But every digital
     project should have someone with business process management skills to help scope and plan the
     alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.”[4]<br><br>
     
    “ The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using ​Agile, iterative processes​ that allow for frequent tweaks
    and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. Your digital project plans should
    be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given
    moment. ”[4]<br> <br>
    "Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in
    projects that drag on way past their scope. Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,”
    or early versions of software that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept is
    worth pursuing. Saying “Let’s launch a perfect site within the next 3 months” without a real business
    plan is a sure path to failure."[4]<br> <br>

    Answering these questions I believe can massively help you to select the right technology to help you produc
    e the best final product to present to your client.<br> <br>
    One scenario would be if a client wanted a website in which one section allowed customers to upload and edit a photo of themselves.<br>
    This project would need a website to be created. <br> - To do this we may use an apple mac computer that has Visual Studio Code installed on it.
    <br> - To write up the informative content for the site we may use a tool or app such a google.docs <br>
    - Then we would possibly have to research for a program similar to Photoshop that can be coded into one of the pages of the site in order to have the photo edit element incorporated onto the final product.</p>
