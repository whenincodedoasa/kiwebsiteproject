        <h1>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h1>
        To test that my digital solutions work I will consistently debug my code in the console.<br>
        By saving and load my content within a web browser to make sure the oput meets the desired client outcomes.<br>
        I will also perform user testing to allow me to gain feedback,<br>
        that communicates if outcomes are being met from the viewpoint of the user, consumer or customer.
