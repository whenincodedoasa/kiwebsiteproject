    <br>
        Using Visual Studio Code in order to create this website I believe is a well suited fit.<br>
        It uses some of the latest coding languages and hosts powerful developer tools that make writing code easy and code testing more efficient.[6]<br>
        <br>As a beginner using Trello is appropriate in order to get you into a habit of constantly reviewing and keeping a note of what you are creating.<br> 
        However it can be a time-consuming tool to use and oftentimes reverse productivity on the 
        actual project itself if being created during the course of the project instead of prior to it by possible a project leader.</p>
