<body><p><h1>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h1>
        The lexico online dictionary refers to copyright as<br><br>
        ‘The exclusive and assignable legal right, given to the originator for a fixed number of years, 
        to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material.’[7]<br><br>
        Copyright can affect the functionality of websites.<br>
        Below is an excerpt that breaks down the ways in which copyright can affect web design and development [8]<br><br>
        “ Websites are particularly open to abuse, especially theft of content and images. You should assume that files will be accessed randomly, downloaded as individual chunks, and distributed out of context. It is therefore important to include a copyright notice on as many individually deliverable items as possible:<br>
        <br>● Image file properties should include a notice.Under Windows for example, right clicking on an image will allow you to bring up the
         properties dialogue where you may enter details about the file, (though this will only work
        with certain file types). More typically, your image software will provide a way to insert
        comments into the file; this is preferred as these are harder to remove.
        <br><br>● Every page should contain a notice in the visible text (text shown on screen), or at least link
        to your notice in the body of the page.
        <br><br>● Every delivered file should include a notice in non visible text.
        For example, in HTML files and CSS stylesheets a copyright notice can be included as a comment.
        Watermarking may be worth considering if you have a lot of valuable images on your site.
        Creating websites for third parties
        <br><br>● If you design web sites for others, it is important for all parties to understand ownership.
        <br><br>● Ensure that rights are transferred or licences granted as appropriate. For example; the copyright to the site content and design may passed to the client upon payment, along with licenses for more generic code or modules that the designer/developer may build or use.
        <br><br>● In the case of work undertaken in stages, rights or licenses to individual features may be handed over for work completed to date.
        <br><br>● Where material for the web site is sourced from elsewhere, or where third party technologies are to be used, appropriate licenses should be obtained.
        <br><br>● Moral rights: Will the developer be credited for the work on the web site? If so, the developer will also want to reserve the right to remove the credit if the site if later developed in a way that would discredit the original developer.”[8]
