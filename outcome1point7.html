    <h1>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h1>
        <br>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. Legally this is the means by which all personal data is handled and processed within a business.
        <br> In the UK this has been implemented within the law.[5a]<br><br>
        ‘The Data Protection Act 2018 is the UK's implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        <br> Everyone responsible for using personal data has to follow strict rules called 'data protection principles'. 
        They must make sure the information is: used fairly, lawfully and transparently.’ [5b]<br><br>
        In a digital project this means we cannot store a person’s information without their permission. This includes making sure that all data is managed appropriately, i.e. stored in a secure system that adheres to the legal policies and protects the component of the system from any possible malware or other cyber threats.
