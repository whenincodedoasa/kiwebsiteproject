        <h1>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that
        people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome
        Them</h1>
        In order to avoid access issues when creating a website some things that may need to be considered 
        to help those with disabilities may include:
        <br><br>● Engineering the site so that it works with loop so that those who have hearing impairments can engage 
        with and sound content on the page.
        <br><br>● Keeping pages simply in the sense of displaying content - People with ADHD or Epilepsy can be 
        triggered or affected by too much content on a page.
        <br><br>● Monitoring the overuse of bright, contrasting colours or extensive use of flashing imagery can also be something to consider
        <br><br>● Those with a visual impairment may benefit from controls or a touch pad to enable them 
        to change the magnification, adding functions within the site that allow emphasis on font size i.e;<br>
         a digital magnifying tool or a resizing percentage button may help them navigate pages better
        <br><br>As a dyslexic user, creative and student junior developer I aim to create making sure to 
        use clear text when developing my designs.<br> I find it helpful for me to take in large 
        amounts of written information when websites include a function that turns text into an audio file.
        <br>It is usually referred to as text-to-speech.
