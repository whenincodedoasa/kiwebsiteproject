        <h1>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project â€“ are you happy with your website?</h1>
        I believe that my website is a showcase of the current level of knowledge and skills I have gained so far into my course.<br> 
        Being that I am not someone who has had a background in this field,I am impressed with my ability to have created a functional product.<br>        However as a creative, although the code is beautiful the output could be a lot more fluid and probably condensed.<br>
        I also feel my website could use more of a creative touch and doesn't fully reflect my personality yet still,
        Im am confident continual practice and development within this sector will provide that space to improve.
