            <h1>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h1>
            <br>In order to achieve my outcomes i used visual studio code to create HTML files in order to give my website structure.<br>
            I then styled the website within Visual Studio Code by creating a CSS file that controls how my 
            content is displayed when launched in a web browser.<br>
            In order to have content to put on my website I used Google docs.<br>
            This allowed me to write up my answers to course work questions which became the content.<br>
            To publish my website i made a repository on Github, which then created a github pages link for which my site could be viewed.
