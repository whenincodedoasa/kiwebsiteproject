            <h1>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h1>
            Given the opportunity;<br><br>Further detailing the website on paper before making it code I believe, 
            would allow me to better organise how i would like my final product to look.<br>
            A deeper education of css and other compatible design programmes would definitely help take the beauty 
            of mere code to code translating to as something more interactive.<br><br>
            Other things within coding that could further improve my website project 
            would be learning how to make buttons or implementing more code that helps with the functionality of the site.<br><br>
            Adding more imagery and applying flexboxing to my code could also improve the user experience as currently the site is mainly just text.
