        achieve your outcomes.</h1> <br>
        Trello is one of the chosen technologies i have used to help with the organisation of my project.<br>
        Its use of lists allows me clearly see what areas need to be reviewed which helps me focus more on areas of the project that are weaker so that the overall product will be balanced.
        <br>Using Trello throughout my website project has helped me evaluate the steps I need to take to build a website.<br><br>
        Another technology is GitHub.<br> Github has allowed me to keep track of modifications when pushed using the Terminal onto the master branch repository.<br>
        By following this procedure the results are that;<br>
        I can then access my work from outside the office and that I can Tweak or modify any of the coding stored in the latest pushed version of my code.
        <br>Also having continuously logged my code makes it easy to restore to a specific version if ever work was lost, unresponsive / made defective or even if i needed to restore to a new machine entirely
