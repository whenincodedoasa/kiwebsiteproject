    <p> <h1>Plan and carry out tasks using IT â€“ e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?</h1>
            <h2>Add a link to your Trello board.</h2><br>
            To help me Plan and kept track of things during this project I have chosen to use Trello, this is an online tool that implements using the kanban method to document tasks.<br>
            <br>I created a board that recorded three list;<br>things I needed to do,<br> was doing<br> and had completed.<br><br> Below is a link to the trello board specific to this project.
            <br><br> <a href =" https://trello.com/b/Gceqz7xG/kis-html-css-website-project" target="_blank">view my website trello board</a>
            <br><br>
            By consistently referring to this list I was able to see what needed work and actively priorities my time.<br>
            Some other features on Trello are the ability to set complete times for tasks,
             invite other users and label and colour code task with referencing.</p>
