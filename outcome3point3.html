    <p><h1>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h1><br>
            Continual Professional Development in the information technology sector is a great way for individuals 
            to improve the way they work within digital projects.<br>
            CPD may look like;<br><br> attending a short intensive course,<br>
             regularly testing code, <br>
             working on side projects ,<br>
              attending networking events and socialising with other people that are different stages in their development
               - (so you can both learn, apply and teach),<br> attending conferences on tech related matters.<br><br>
            Within the workplace, code sharing can help increase productivity in writing code.<br>
            The tool best used in practice for this is slack.<br>
            Slack is an app that can be opened across many multimedia platforms which makes it easily accessible.<br>
             As a member I am able to create group chats in which code can be shared, I converse with team mates, 
             or any other professionals who use the app by entering different groups.<br> 
             I can share imagery, links etc. This encourages positive team-work and is good for team building.
