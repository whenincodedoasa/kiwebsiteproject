        For my website I created an initial entry page that contains some food for 
        thought and click in link which takes you to my project home page.<br><br>
        On my project home page you can find out a bit about me my hopes and aims in relation to the course and 
        the two assignment menu bars titled Unit 1 Outcomes & Unit 2 Outcomes.<br><br>
        On each menu bar is buttons that take you into each outcome per units title page.<br><br>
        Each title page hosts further navigation bars that allows you to go between outcome question pages.<br><br>
        My website also contains an extra page that is purposely mistitled but allows you to view all references.
