<h1>Welcome to Ki’s world where Creativity meets Code. </h1>
<p>My name is Ki Martin, I am a Creative Entrepreneur and an enthusiastic Student Junior Developer.</p>
<p>My interest in coding began in my younger years, while investigating the code behind my theme on a blogging site called Tumblr. I found joy in playing around with the code, in attempts to make me page look more aesthetically pleasing and reflect my creative classy personality . </p>
<p>Although I had this initial interest as a child I wasn’t aware of any opportunities to further explore and learn more in the Digital and Information Technology sector.<br>
Now as a young adult I have been presented an opportunity to do that through the courses offered with CodeNation.|</p>
<p> I decided to enroll onto the develop coding course in order to gain new transferable skills that could launch a career into becoming a Web developer that specialises in Front End Development and Design.
<br>From attending this course so far, I’ve begun to understand the world of web development more in depth. 
Studying with codenation has provided me the chance to network with people from various backgrounds as the course is not age or skill specific Develop: Coding is open to all.
Sitting in on pledger talks with representatives from companies such as Barclays, Dice Creative & Bring Digital, has provided the space to ask questions and take away advice on how to positively build in this sector.
<br>
<br>This experience so far, though challenging sometimes, has been very inspirational and im excited to continue growing.
