<h1>Welcome to Ki’s world where Creativity meets Code. </h1>
<p>My name is Ki Martin, I am a Creative Entrepreneur and an enthusiastic Student Junior Developer.</p>
<p>My interest in coding began in my younger years, while investigating the code behind my theme on a blogging site called Tumblr. I found joy in playing around with the code, in attempts to make me page look more aesthetically pleasing and reflect my creative classy personality . </p>
<p>Although I had this initial interest as a child I wasn’t aware of any opportunities to further explore and learn more in the Digital and Information Technology sector.<br>
Now as a young adult I have been presented an opportunity to do that through the courses offered with CodeNation.|</p>
<p>I decided to enroll onto the develop coding course in order to gain a new transferable skill that could launch a career into becoming a Web developer that specialises in Front End Development and Design.</p>
