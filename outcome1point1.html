        Describing the purpose of IT in modern business?
        Mirriam-webster dictionary defines information technology (I.T) as ‘the technology involving the development, maintenance, and use of computer systems, software, and networks for the processing and distribution of data’ [1]
     <br><br>   Simply put, I would say that I.T is the method used to help organize, maintain and share information, worldwide.<br>
        <br>The purpose of I.T being used within modern business is to help manage and assess the operational functions of a business 
        and how it both publicly and privately presents itself.<br> By implementing I.T it helps companies provide services that meet consumer demands and in turn make profit. [2]
