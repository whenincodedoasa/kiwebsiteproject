    <p> <h1> the purpose of IT in modern business? </h1>
        <br><br>
            Mirriam-webster dictionary defines information technology (I.T) as ‘the technology involving the development, maintenance, and use of computer systems, software, and networks for the processing and distribution of data’ [1]
            Simply put, I would say that I.T is the method used to help organize, maintain and share information, worldwide.
            The purpose of I.T being used within modern business is to help manage and assess the operational functions of a business and how it both publicly and privately presents itself. By implementing I.T it helps companies provide services that meet consumer demands and in turn make profit. [2]
