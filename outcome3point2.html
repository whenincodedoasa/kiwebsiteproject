    <p><h1>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h1>
            <br>One way in which you can increase productivity on a project may be to offer incentives for reaching goals or completing certain tasks by a specific time.
            <br><br>An example of this I set while working on the website project is that I would treat myself to a 
            pack of sweets after I completed writing up the code that forms the basic structure of my website.<br>
             Setting this Incentive worked perfectly in increasing productivity for me as Iâ€™m a major foodie.<br><br>
            Taking scheduled breaks between tasks can massively improve efficiency within a project as it encourages your mind to relax.<br>
             And it's better to tackle tasks with a mind that is well rested and clear as opposed to one that's tired, full of stress and tension.
