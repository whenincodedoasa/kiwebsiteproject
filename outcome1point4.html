    <p><h1>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail & why?</h1>
            <br><br>There are many things that impact the success of a digital project some basic thoughts that come to mind are:
            <br>● Lack of current or up to date knowledge of software packages or coding principles<br>
            ● Failure to plan properly<br>
            ● Failure to consistently test prototypes<br>
            <br>However when researching I also found that sometimes project failure can be down to things that more look at the company’s make up itself such as:
            <br><br>● Project not aligning with the business /companies current technology structure.<br><br>       
        “Initiative is very likely to fail when teams put technology ahead of strategy, often falling for the hype
             of using new innovative tools on a project before considering the business process implications of
             the new technology."[4]<br><br>
             ● Lack of team diversity with a project.<br><br>
             " project should have someone with business process management skills to help scope and plan the
             alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.”[4]<br><br>        
            ● Not giving enough consideration to the expense of time and resources on a project and how it can impact the business on a larger scale.<br>
            <br>● Fixed plans that don’t account for change<br>
<br>“ The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using ​Agile, iterative processes​ that allow for frequent tweaks
and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. Your digital project plans should
be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given
moment. ”[4]<br><br>
            ● Overambition<br><br>
            "Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in
projects that drag on way past their scope. Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,”
or early versions of software that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept is
worth pursuing. Saying 'Let’s launch a perfect site within the next 3 months' without a real business
plan is a sure path to failure."[4]<br><br>

            Fun fact ‘a​ survey on digital project execution a few years ago and found:<br>
            – Traditional projects: 47% are successful, 36% are challenged, and 17% are failures<br>
            – Ad-hoc projects: 49% are successful, 37% are challenged, and 14% are failures<br>
            – Agile projects: 60% are successful, 28% are challenged, and 12% are failures.’ [4]</p>
