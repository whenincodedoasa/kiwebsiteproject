<body><p><h1>which are the appropriate file types for websites</h1>
        To describe what is appropriate as a file type for a website all depends on what you intend for your website to do or display.<br>
        The most basic two file types that are used when developing websites are HTML and CSS.<br>
        These allow you to format basic web pages and add styling to them to give the page a basic layout / style.<br><br>
        Below is a list of some other file types which are commonly used for websites and a short description for what they do.<br><br>
        <h3>Internet File Formats</h3>
        ● .AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved.
        <br>● .CSS — Cascading StyleSheet.
        <br>● .DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument.
        <br>● .EXE — EXEcutable file.
        <br>● .GIF — Graphics Interchange Format.
        <br>● .HTML/ .HTM — HyperText Markup Language file.

        <br><br>During this project I learnt the importance of using the appropriate file 
        type when I attempted to make a MP4 file one of my web page backgrounds.</p>
