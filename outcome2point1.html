        <h1>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed.</h1>
        My experience using Visual Studio Code so far has been fairly smooth, I feel that is an app 
        that is very beginner friendly and makes code alot easier to read and understand
         due to it automation colour coding feature.<br>
        I look forward to continually using this and creating digital products with it.<br>
        <br><br>In contrast Trello for me thought efficient for logging information and organising is not a tool 
        I personally enjoy using or would choose to use as I prefer to see a plans ‘to-do’ list in 
        checklist format on paper.<br> Also for Trello boards to remain effective requires an individual consistently 
        remembering to log in and update as it isn’t linked directly to your code or any other tool in which you would action the tasks.
        <br><br>GitHub has been a wonderful tool to use as it helps not only make my code more easily accessible but 
        as it stores my file externally; it leaves my user desktop looking clean and free of clutter.<br><br>
        Since being introduced to Slack it has become a tool im actively using not only for 
        code sharing and conversing with tutor and peers but in order to send myself files more easily. 
        <br>It has definitely been a go-to tool during the project.<br><br>
